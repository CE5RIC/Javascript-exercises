Overview and remarks on my Javascript Exercises (Base, Colors, Dates and Maths)

01 Base

These exercises were solvable for me without having the need to look up things. Not saying it's the most efficient code but got through it with by just setting up some variables, using the prompt method and some IF ELSE statements here and there.

02 Colors

Had to dig deeper as I didn't have any understanding of the DOM and their events. Did some additional reading on Developer.Mozilla to get a better understanding of these concepts. For the solution of the third exercise I googled, had heard about the Math.Random method but needed the internet to find the additional code for this one.

03 Dates

Here things got more difficult and especially had troubles with the 3rd exercise. Got it working to a certain degree in the console but still far from the demanded result. Eventually went to the code of my fellow Becode Student Yasser for this one, there was a short remark with each step he proceeded and this helped me understand the path he had chosen to solve this. Didn't do the optional exercises yet but might have to come back to solidify my knowledge.

04 Math

Finished the first exercise. I got off to a good start but had some difficulty as well. Yasser put me into the right direction and learned a great deal on let, const and the method parseInt for this one. Will be tackling the next two Math exercises soon!

# The fields: JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

## Structure

The file consists of several exercises, divided into 7 series.
Don't be afraid of the large amount of exercises: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

Some exercises are marked as optional, feel free to continue with the next chapter and come back to those exercises later.

### Local server

Some exercises may require running the code on a _local server_.  
This is a good practice that should always be applied. Maybe, you have already install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) on your machines. If not, do it ;).
If you want to configure correctly the global settings of npm [follow this article](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory).

We prepared for you a local server to use from your command line called [**sèvè**](https://github.com/leny/seve).

Then, use your terminal to _navigate_ to your repo and run the following commands :

    npm install
    npm start

If everything ir right, your default's browser will be opened on the address [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).

### Section 11 - fetch

For the _fetch_ exercises, you are going to need to query a REST API.
We have provided you with a small script to run this API locally.

Open a second terminal, then _navigate_ to the repo folder. Then issue the following commands :

    npm run api

From there, you will have a REST API available at `http://localhost:3000`
